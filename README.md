* **Fundamental Stock Price Cycles**

	- **Abstract.** News shocks about higher future capital returns can explain stock price-booms and subsequent -busts in a two-asset, heterogeneous agent New Keynesian model. The portfolio choice between liquid assets (like stocks) and illiquid capital is key, as it allows for a time-varying illiquidity premium. Upon the news, capital-rich households accept to hold more illiquid capital at a lower premium, in anticipation of higher future returns on it. This increases their consumption risk, and causes stock prices to rise. After the boom, capital-rich households trade capital for liquid assets in order to self-insure against idiosyncratic income shocks, which increases the illiquidity premium, and causes stock prices to fall. Novel evidence from survey data on portfolio choices of capital-wealthy households during stock price boom-bust cycles supports the key mechanism of the model.

* **Surveying Price Stickiness with Large Shocks** (with Thomas Kohler)
	- **Abstract.** We conduct a survey among German hairdressers about their reasons for adjusting their prices during the Covid-19 pandemic. The most important reason not to increase prices is the fear of losing regular customers, while the most important reasons to increase prices refer to higher costs. We find that firms who report that their customers are more understanding of their prices are more likely to increase prices. Constructing a distribution of relative prices of hairdressers, we also find that the real price rigidity that stems from low understanding is most prevalent in the center of the distribution. We rationalize these findings in the context of a search model, where customers are uncertain about the size of an industry-wide cost shock. Firms with more understanding regular customers are more able to blame higher prices on the cost shock, which keeps their customers from searching for other firms. With heterogeneity in both quality of service and production costs, firms that charge the median price are least likely to be monopolists.
