description: I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Tuebingen. In my research, I analyze macroeconomic questions connecting evidence on the aggregate level with micro-level data, using structural models. I also work on computational methods for heterogeneous agent models. I hold a PhD in Economics from the University of Bonn.
